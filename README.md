# NagarAI - Digital City Management

**Empowering Citizens, Fixing Cities.**

NagarAI is a digital platform connecting citizens with government authorities to solve civic issues efficiently. By leveraging AI for issue classification and routing, we ensure that problems like potholes, blocked drains, and electrical hazards are addressed promptly and transparently.

-   **Precise Geolocation:** GPS accuracy ensures authorities know exactly where the problem is.
-   **Transparency Log:** Publicly viewable status for every report.
-   **Citizen Verification:** Tickets are only closed after the reporting citizen verifies the fix.
